# PyHillFit

This new repo is where I plan to re-write my old PyHillFit code that I used in my [DPhil](https://rhjohnstone.github.io/dphil/) in a slightly more user-friendly, OO way.

This is (eventually) for uncertainty characterisation and propagation in [dose-response curve fitting to ion channel screening data](https://rhjohnstone.github.io/pyhillfit/).

Currently, it just does sum-of-squares best-fit finding. I will hopefully add the MCMC code when I have time.

There is also a GUI version of (best-fit) dose-response curve fitting, which will do and plot best fits for each model (Hill=1 or allowing Hill to vary).
